## This is a Data Science Project
It is all about creating algorithms and functions to return information
from a large data set. To do this, you will explore 'libraries' and 'snippets'
that will make your life easier.

jupyter, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy ... and others

There are numerous tutorials you can do to build capacity in this project.

The base line solution will run in the console and will pop out some charts.

Better solutions might use Tkinter to create a GUI version and even package that as a product.

Another version might use Flask or other web-dev environment to make it a HTML5 solution.

This project will give you hands on skills - ONLY if you work on tuutorials and test the dataset. You and your partner have to choose a direction. Remember to allow 5/6 hours for the documentation of this project which will be around 20 pages including screen shots.

You must make progress and document the progress using GitHub.

There will be a weekly 'check in' with me to see progress.

Good luck
